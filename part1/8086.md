# Intel 8086 microprocessor family

Created om 1978. ASM-86 (the 8086/8088 assembly language).
EU - execution unit.
BIU - bus interface unit.
Intel uses `h` suffix to mark a hex value. In C, we use `0x` prefix for that
4096 == 1000h == 0x1000

### General Registers

There are eight 16-bit general registers. The general registers are subdivided into two sets of four registers each;
the data registers (H & L group for "high" and "low"),
and the pointer and index registers (P & I group).

The data registers are unique in that their upper (high) and lower halves are separately addressable.
The other CPU registers are always accessed as 16-bit units __only__.

```
|     16    |
|-----| ----|
|  8  |  8  |
| --- | ----|
| ah  | al  | -> ax (accumulator)
| bh  | bl  | -> bx (base)
| ch  | cl  | -> cx (count)
| dh  | dl  | -> dx (data)
|    sp     | -> stack pointer
|    bp     | -> base pointer
|    si     | -> source index
|    di     | -> destination index
```

Some instructions use certain registers implicitly. This is needed for compact encoding

### Segment Registers

The megabyte of 8086 memory space is divided into logical segments of up to 64k bytes each.
The CPU has direct access to 4 segments at a time;
1. `CS` register points to the current code segment; instructions are fetched from this segment.
2. `SS` register points to the current stack segment; stack operations are performed on locations in this segment.
3. `DS` register points to the current data segment; it generally contains the program variables.
4. `ES` register points to the current extra segment, which also is typically used for data storage.

### Instruction Pointer
Instruction Pointer (IP) is a 16-bit pointer that points to the next instruction.

### Flags
There are 3 1-bit Control Flags & 6 1-bit status flags.
-- Control Flags
1. `TF` - Trap
2. `DF` - Direction
3. `IF` - Interrupt-enable
-- Status Flags
4. `OF` - Overflow
5. `SF` - Sign
6. `ZF` - Zero
7. `AF` - Auxiliary carry
8. `PF` - Parity
9. `CF` - Carry

### Memory
The data is stored with the most-significant byte in the higher memory location (Little Endian).
`SS` contains the base  address of the current stack and `SP` points to the top of the stack (TOS).
In other words, SP contains the offset of the top of the stack from the stack segment's base address.
In 8086, stack is 16 bits wide. An item is pushed onto the stack by __decrementing__ `SP` by 2 and writing the imer at the new TOS.
An item is popped off the stack by copying it from TOS and then __incrementing__ `SP` by 2.

### Instructions
The "MANUAL" Section 2.7 Instruction set. p. 2-30

#### Data transfers

__MOV__ _destination_, _source_
Move transfers a byte of a word from the source __operand__ to the destination __operand__.

__PUSH__ _source_
PUSH decrements `SP`(stack pointer) by 2 and then transfers a word from the source operand to the top of the stack now pointed by SP.
PUSH often is used to place parameters on the stack before calling a procedure; more generally,
it is the basic means of storing temporary data on the stack.

__POP__ _destination_
POP transfers the word at the current top of the stack (pointed to by SP) to the destination operand,
and then increments `SP` by 2 to point to the new top of the stack (TOS).

__XCHG__ _destination_, _source_
XCHG (exchange) switches the contents of the source and destination operands.

__IN__ _accumulator_, _port_
IN transfers a byte or a word from an input port to the __AL__ or __AX__ register.
The port number may be specified either with an immediate byte constant (0-255)
or with a number previously placed in the __DX__ register, allowing variable access (0-65,535)


__OUT__ _port_, _accumulator_
OUT transfers a byte or a word from the __AL__ or __AX__ register to an output port.
The port number may be specified either with an immediate byte constant (0-255)
or with a number previously placed in the __DX__ register, allowing variable access (0-65,535)

#### Arithmetic

Arithmetic operations may be performed on four types of numbers:
- unsigned binary
- signed binary
- unsigned packed decimal
- unsigned unpacked decimal

Unpacked Decimal (also called BCD - Binary-Coded Decimal):
Each byte stores ONE decimal digit (0-9). It only uses the lower 4 bits of each byte, the upper 4 bits are typically zero.
Example: The number 25 would be stored as:
```
0010 0101  (two separate bytes)
^^^^ ^^^^
2    5
```

Packed Decimal:
Each byte stores TWO decimal digits (0-9). It uses all 8 bits efficiently.
Example: The number 25 would be stored as:
```
0010 0101  (one byte)
^^^^ ^^^^
2    5
```

I was used for Business applications where exact decimal precision was required (avoiding binary floating-point errors),
but now we can use integers and just specify the scaling factor; e.g. we can store everything in cents, therefore 0.1 dollar becomes 100 cents. The scaling factor is 100.

Unsigned numbers - 8 or 16 bits
`[0 - 255]` or `[0 - 65,535]`

Signed numbers - 8 or 16 bits.
`[-128 - 127]` or `[-32,768 - 32,767]`
The high-order (leftmost) bit is interpreted as the number's sign:
0 - positive
1 - negative

Negative numbers are represented in standard two's complement notation.
Basically, we flip the bits and add 1.
The "flip the bits" can be done either by using _unary NOT_ or _XOR 0xFF_.

The Multiplication and Division are provided for _signed_ binary numbers.
Addition and Subtraction are performed with the _unsigned_ binary numbers.


__ADD__ _destination_, _source_
Addition:
Addend + Addend = Sum (Доданок + Доданок = Сума)

The sum of 2 operands. Replaces the destination operant.
Updates the following flags: AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.


__ADC__ _destination_, _source_
ADC (Add with Carry) sums the operands, adds one if CF is set and replaces the destination operand with the result.
Updates the following flags: AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.


__INC__ _destination_
INC (Increment) adds one to the destination operand.
Updates the following flags: AF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.


__SUB__ _destination_, _source_
Subtraction:
Minuend - Subtrahend = Difference (Зменшуване - Від'ємник = Різниця)

The source operand is subtracted from the destination operand, and the result replaces the destination operand.
Updates the following flags: AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.

__DEC__ _destination_
DEC (Decrement) subtracts one from the destination.
Updates the following flags: AF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.


__NEG__ _destination_
NEG (Negate) subtracts the destination operand from 0 and returns the result to the destination.
Same as `* (-1)` (flip the sign)
Updates the following flags: AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.


__CMP__ _destination_, _source_
CMP (Compare) subtracts the _source_ from the _destination_, but does not return the result (doesn't mutate the register).
The operands are _unchanged_, but the flags are updated and can be tested by a subsequent conditional jump instruction.
Updates the following flags: AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.
The comparison reflected in the flags is that of the __destination to the source__.
e.g. if a CMP instruction is followed by a JG (jump if greater) instruction, the jump is taken is the destination operand
is greater than the source operand


__MUL__ _source_
Multiplication:
Multiplicand * Multiplier = Product (Множене * Множник = Добуток)

MUL (Multiply) performs an _unsigned_ multiplication of the source operand and the accumulator.
If the source is a byte, then it is multiplied by register __AL__, and the double-length result is returned in AH and AL.
If the source is a word, then it is multiplied by register __AX__, and the double-length result is returned in registers DX (high word) and AX (low word).

The double-length is needed because if I multiply the biggest numbers of the register, the result won't fit.
e.g. 255 (AL) * 255 (source) is 65,025, which only fits in 16 bit register.
Even if I do 1 (AL) * 1 (source) it will still take the double-length register AX
`AX` and `DX` are fixed for MUL operation.

The `CF` and `OF` flags indicate that AH or DX contain significant digits of the result


__IMUL__ _source_
IMUL (Integer Multiply) performs a _signed_ multiplication of the source operand and the accumulator.


__DIV__ _source_
Division:
Dividend / Divisor = Quotient (+Remainder) (Ділене / Дільник = Частка (+Остача))

DIV (divide) performs an _unsigned_ division of the accumulator (and its extension) by the source operand.
If the source is a byte, it is divided into the double-length dividend assumed to be in registers AL and AH.
The single-length quotient is returned in __AL__, and the single-length remainder is returned in __AH__

If the source is a word, it is divided into the double-length dividend in registers AX and DX.
The single-length quotient is returned in __AX__. The single-length remainder is returned in __DX__.

```
DIV source   ; Here:
            ; DX:AX contains the Dividend
            ; source is the Divisor
            ; AX gets the Quotient
            ; DX gets the Remainder
```


__IDIV__ _source_
IDIV (Integer Divide) performs a _signed_ division of the accumulator (and its extension) by the source operand.


__CBW__
CBW (Convert Byte to Word) extends the sign of the byte in register __AL__ throughout register __AH__


__CWD__
CWD (Convert Word to Double word) extends the signe of the word in register __AX__ throughout register __DX__

#### Logic

__NOT__ _destination_
NOT inverts the bits (forms the one's complement) of the byte or word operand


__AND__ _destination_, _source_
AND performs the logical "and" of the 2 operands and _returns_ the result to the destination operand


__OR__ _destination, _source_
OR performs logical "inclusive OR" of the two operands and _returns_ the result to the destination operand


__XOR__ _destination_, _source_
XOR (Exclusive OR) performs the logical "exclusive or" of the two operands and _returns_ the result to the destination operand.


__TEST__ _destination_, _source_
TEST performs the logical "and" of the 2 operands, updates the flags, but does _not return_ the result.

#### Strings
There are primitives that allow strings of bytes or words to be operated on, one element at a time.
The hardware assumes that a source string resides in the current data segment;
a segment prefix byte may be used to override this assumption.
The content of the register __SI__ (source index) is used as an offset to address the current element of the source string,
and the content of the register __DI__ (destination index) is taken as the offset of the current destination string element.
These registers must be initialized to point to the source/destination strings before executing the string instruction;
the LDS, LES, LEA instructions are useful in this regard.

| Register/Flag | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| SI            | Index (offset) for source string                     |
| DI            | Index (offset) for destination string                |
| CX            | Repetition counter                                   |
| AL/AX         | Scan value, Destination for LODS, Source for STOS    |
| DF            | 0 = auto-increment SI, DI; 1 = auto-decrement SI, DI |
| ZF            | Scan/compare terminator                              |

The string instructions __automatically__ update __SI__ and/or __DI__ in anticipation of processing the next string element.
The setting of __DF__ (direction flag) determines whether the index registers are auto-incremented (DF = 0) or auto-decremented (DF = 1).

If byte strings are being processed, _SI_ and _DI_ is adjusted by 1; in case of the word string - 2.

| Instruction | Description                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| REP         | Repeat                          |
| REPE/REPZ   | Repeat while equal/zero         |
| REPNE/REPNZ | Repeat while not equal/not zero |
| MOVS        | Move byte or word string        |
| MOVSB/MOVSW | Move byte or word string        |
| CMPS        | Compare byte or word string     |
| SCAS        | Scan byte or word string        |
| LODS        | Load byte or word string        |
| STOS        | Store byte or word string       |

REP/REPE/REPZ/REPNE/REPNZ - are a prefix byte that controls the repetition of a subsequent string instruction.

__REP__ is used in conjunction with the __MOVS__ (Move string) and __STOS__ (Store string)
and is interpreted as "repeat while not end-of-string" (CX not 0).

__REPE__ and __REPZ__ are used with the __CMPS__ (Compare string) and __SCAS__ (Scan string) instructions
and require __ZF__ to be set before initializing the next repetition.

__REPNE__ and __REPNZ__ do the same, except that the __ZF__ flag must be cleared or the repetition is terminated.
Note that __ZF__ does not need to be initialized before execution.


__MOVS__ _destination-string_, _source-string_
MOVS (Move String) transfers a byte or a word from the source string (SI) to the destination string (DI)
and updates SI abd DI to point to the next string element.

__MOVSB/MOVSW__

These mnemonics are coded without operands; They explicitly tell the assembler that a byte string (MOVSB)
or a word string (MOVSW) is to be moved.
These mnemonics are useful when the assembler cannot determine the attributes of a string, e.g. a section of a code
being moved.


__CMPS__ _destination-string_, _source-string_
CMPS(Compare String) subtracts the destination byte or word (addressed by DI)
from the source byte or word (addressed by SI).
COMPS affects the flags, but does not alter either operand, updates __SI__ and __DI__ to point to the next string element.
Updates the following flags: AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF.
If CMPS is prefixed with __REPE__ or __REPZ__, the operation is interpreted as "compare while not end-of-string (CX != 0) and
strings are equal (ZF = 1)".
IF CMPS is preceded by __REPNE__ or __REPNZ__, the operation is interpreted as
"compare while not end-of-string (CX != 0) and strings are not equal (ZF = 0)".

This form may be used to __find matching or differing__ elements.
Example:
```asm
.data
    str1 db 'Hello',0
    str2 db 'Hello',0
    len equ 5

.code
    mov cx, len        ; Length to compare
    mov si, offset str1
    mov di, offset str2
    repe cmpsb        ; Compare while equal
    je strings_match  ; If ZF=1, strings matched
```

__SCAS__ _destination-string_
SCAS (Scan String) subtracts the destination string element addressed by __DI__ from the content of AL/AX register.
It updates the flags, but does not alter the destination-string or the accumulator.
SCAS also updates DI to point to the next string element and AF, CF, OF, PF, SF, ZF flags.
If prefixed with __REPE__ or __REPZ__ the operation is interpreted as "scan while no end-of-string (CX != 0) and
string-element == scan-value (ZF=1)".
If prefixed with __REPNE__ or __REPNZ__ the operation is interpreted as "scan while not end-of-string (CX != 0) and
string-element is not equal to scan-value (ZF = 0)".

This form may be used to __locate a value__ in a string
Example:

```asm
.data
   text db 'Hello,World',0
   len equ 11

.code
   mov cx, len        ; Length to scan
   mov di, offset text
   mov al, ','        ; Looking for comma
   repne scasb        ; Scan while not comma
   je found_comma     ; ZF=1 means comma found
```

__LODS__ _source-string_
LODS (Load String) transfers the byte or word string element addressed by __SI__ to register __AL/AX__,
and updates __SI__ to point to the next element in the string.
This is more useful as a part of a more complex string function, because it overrides the accumulator on each iteration.

__STOS__ _destination-string_
STOS (Store String) transfers a byte or word from register __AL/AX__ to the string element addressed by __DI__ and updates
__DI__ to point to the next location in the string.


#### Interrupt

__INT__ _interrupt-type_
INT(Interrupt) activates the interrupt procedure specified by the interrupt-type operand.
If interrupt-type = _3_, the assembler generates a short (1 byte) form of the instruction, known as the _breakpoint interrupt_.

W field – 8th bit of the instruction. "Word" or "byte" operation. 0 means byte, 1 means word.

The second byte of the instruction usually identifies the instruction's operands.

MOD – 2 bits. "Mode" field indicates whether one of the operands is in memory or whether both operands are in registers.
REG - 3 bits. "Register" field identifies a register that is one of the instruction operands
R/M - 3 bits. "Register/Memory" field. If the MOD field indicates that the operand is in memory, the R/M field
identifies the memory location. If the MOD field indicates that both operands are in registers, the R/M field identifies
the second register.
